# Sharecost

Sharecost allows you to split the cost of any purchase! Login with your Venmo account and add your friends to a purchase!

###Instructions for Aaron:

Log in with Venmo and create a purchase that you would like to split evenly with a group of people. Currently, as of iter3, you can invite any of your Venmo friends but they have to login to Sharecost to complete the purchase.

### Testing:

Testing only takes place when you run `meteor run` locally on your own machine in this projects directory. It fires up Velocity which you can see as a blue or green dot in the top right hand corner of the screen. The tests usually take about 30 seconds to fully run.

To run without tests:
JASMINE_SERVER_UNIT=0 JASMINE_SERVER_INTEGRATION=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_UNIT=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_INTEGRATION=0 meteor
