# Sharecost: This was a group project for CS169 (Fall 2015) with members Trent McCormick, Nathan Chong, Joel Terry and Alex Ma.

Sharecost allows you to split the cost of any purchase! Login with your Venmo account and add your friends to a purchase!

###Instructions for Aaron:

Log in with Venmo and create a purchase that you would like to split evenly with a group of people. Currently, as of iter3, you can invite any of your Venmo friends but they have to login to Sharecost to complete the purchase.

### Testing:

Testing only takes place when you run `meteor run` locally on your own machine in this projects directory. It fires up Velocity which you can see as a blue or green dot in the top right hand corner of the screen. The tests usually take about 30 seconds to fully run.

To run without tests:
JASMINE_SERVER_UNIT=0 JASMINE_SERVER_INTEGRATION=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_UNIT=0 JASMINE_CLIENT_INTEGRATION=0 meteor
